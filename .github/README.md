<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project started because I wanted to self host my own photo gallery. 
While I was making it I decided to make it open source so that others could use it as well. I hope you enjoy it!

The purpose of this project is to create a simple and easy to use photo and video gallery that can be self hosted. 
The goals is to have an interface where images and videos are uploaded, thumbnails are generated, and the images and videos are then displayed in a gallery.

See the roadmap for a full list of features.
